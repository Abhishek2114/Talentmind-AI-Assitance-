## ⚔️ Key Weapons (Core Features)

- **Vision-Based Resume Parsing:** Uses Gemini's multi-modal capabilities to "see" and parse unstructured PDF data, preserving layout context that traditional text-extractors lose.
- **Deterministic Skill Matrix:** 0% hallucination rate on critical data. We use set-logic intersection to map extracted profile skills against extracted JD requirements.
- **Strategic Resume Feedback:** Actionable coaching generated via contextual analysis, focusing on high-impact metrics and phrasing.
- **Automated Job Discovery:** Real-world opportunity sourcing based on the identified candidate profile.
