## 🏗️ System Architecture: The Intelligence Layer

The platform utilizes a high-performance, serverless architecture designed for low latency and high data integrity. It leverages **Firebase Genkit v1.x** for production-grade AI orchestration.

### Technical Stack
- **Engine:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Multi-Modal Vision)
- **Orchestration:** Firebase Genkit v1.x (Stable)
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **UI Architecture:** Glassmorphic Cyber-Tech (Tailwind + ShadCN)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## ⚔️ Weapon Specifications (Core Features)

- **Vision-Based Resume Parsing:** Uses Gemini's multi-modal capabilities to "see" and parse unstructured PDF data, preserving layout context that traditional text-extractors lose.
- **Deterministic Skill Matrix:** 0% hallucination rate on critical data. We use set-logic intersection to map extracted profile skills against extracted JD requirements.
- **Strategic Resume Coaching:** Actionable, context-aware feedback generated via deep analysis of job requirements versus candidate history.
- **Automated Opportunity Discovery:** Real-world job sourcing from major platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) based on identified candidate profile.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide (Vercel)

Deploying TalentMind AI to Vercel is seamless:

1.  **Connect to GitHub:** Link your repository (`Abhishek2114/TalentMind-Ai`) in the Vercel dashboard.
2.  **Environment Variables:** Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
3.  **Build Settings:** Vercel automatically detects Next.js 15 settings. The included `vercel.json` ensures serverless functions have a **60s timeout** for deep AI processing.
4.  **Launch:** Click "Deploy." Your weapon is ready.

## 🛡️ Engineering & Reliability

- **Consolidated Flow Orchestration:** Minimizes API latency by bundling parsing, analysis, and job discovery into a single atomic operation.
- **Modern React Stack:** Built on **Next.js 15** and **React 19** utilizing Server Actions and the `useActionState` hook for zero-latency UI updates.
- **Robust Dependency Management:** Aligned with Genkit 1.x stable versions with strict peer-dependency resolution.
